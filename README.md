# DataAlgorithms
Data and Algorithms school work. 2023.

This project requires CMake to build.\

Visual Studio users can just download the 'C++ CMake tools for Windows', from within Visual Studio.\
Just open the folder like normal and Visual Studio will load it as a CMake project.

The source code is in /src

## Building on GNU/Linux using CMake, GCC, and Make
Prerequisites: CMake, gcc, make
You can probably build using other tools and compilers but this works for me.\
From the git repository you downloaded, run these commands.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```
